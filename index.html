        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a student at the University of California Riverside, transferring to the University of California: Irvine, next year, to major in Business Economics.<br><br>

        Having experience in both the biochemistry world and the business world as well, I see myself as a well rounded individual, who has gained experience in professional work spaces. Through experiences such as a summer internship at Micropoint Bioscience in Santa Clara, California, and experiences such as ranking nationally in high school DECA competitions, I have gained a lot of experience in multiple fields. During my time at Micropoint Bioscience, I was able to shadow the head scientist, Dr. Yining Shih, during his daily lab activities. With this, I also performed experiments of my own, learning how to utilize lab equipment, such as micropipets, and the different reagents that I worked with in the lab. Micropoint mainly worked to develop methods that would assist both patients and doctors in detecting health issues through blood testing. At micropoint, I was able to shadow and assist different scientists, as they would test the blood in the devices that they had developed. Overall, my time at Micropoint was very rewarding, and career orienting. <br><br>

        With my experience in DECA, I found a lot of success while I competed, which led me to also discover my passion in business, hence why I am trasferring to the University of California: Irvine, to pursue business economics, with the intentions of becoming a certified public accountant. I found a lot of success in DECA, qualifying to compete nationally, eventually placing top 10 in the management event that I competed in. With this, I gained three years of experience of forming marketing and management plans, which helped to further my interest in the business field. Although I did not realize my passion for business at first, I soon realized that pursuing a career in business instead of biochemistry would make me the happiest, thus allowing me to find the most success in my career. I plan on increasing my experience in business through internships in the following years, which would allow me to grow both my passion and my experience in the business field.
